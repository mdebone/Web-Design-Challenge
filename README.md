# Web-Design-Challenge

Okay got around not being able to add the index.html by adding a notebook and changing it to index.html

I had a technical difficulty with this assignment in that none of the GitLab lessons, days 1 to 3, didn't have anything in them. Typically there are 10 to 15 assignments for each of the days, but all of these were marked down with a '=========' and nothing else.
Did not impact any of the other lessons, but I could not stash and delete the currupted files on my end and then re-pull, since git said that it was already up to date. I went thru line by line to make sure that my conda had the correct installations, both base(the default and my PythonData) had everything that I needed. GitLab was the same, each one of the lessons was marked down with those slashes, so I reached out to my class and support classmates thru slack, no resolution there.
I was forced to watch the zoom videos to have a reference point for the creation of the website and that is not nearly as efficent as just being able to read. 

The issue has been resolved, but it came this afternoon. So I am still working on this and will resubmit as soon as it is something that resembles the requirements.

So I have a few days to revisit this and fully intend to finish the necessary updates, fully understand why the central grader gave the comments that they did, it looks as though I did not update the remote to even a fraction of what I have in my local repository,
I mean, to be sure, a lot of this is going to be trashed outright or salvage maybe 2 or 3 lines of code that get incorporated into the final push but still surprising to see the differential. I pushed it all since I am just now getting my bearings again on this topic 
and cant definitaviely say one way or the other if something is going to have long term value or not. To the larger scope of the project, the issues that I was experiencing earlier with the python challenge and the mars scrapping challenges, knock on wood, seem to have disappeared. Even if I don't consider myself to be fatalistic, I have a certain expectation that by simply calling the 'all clear' status outloud will,
undoubtedly turn the gaze of Olympus upon my endeverors and bring forth long term issues for my completion of this project.

I say, let it be thus.

Okay but seriously, if we stop using a latin text script placeholder for future content, ill stop pontificating old testiment style. Things to do, populate the 4 charts as the instructions specify, they're all static it seems, derived from a csv. Second step is to find a dataset that will server the purposes of the bonus challenge, Google's datasearch had a really interesting analysis of online datsets using dataset search, published in part, as a dataset (link) https://www.kaggle.com/googleai/dataset-search-metadata-for-datasets,
I was tempted to go with it based off the summary report article I read, the kaggle metadataset is actually 11.43 GB so that snuffed out that idea rather quickly, even if it meta-ness made the idea appealing, think I'll go with a water quality dataset, sort of fits the theme of the suggested data which was weather.

So I need the header element for the 4 suggested charts, with a dropdown element that selects the charts, a comparison of X chart to Y chart element in the header, and a data element which looks just to be an individual summary of each of the four.
All four seem to require a summary paragraph and so will need to do that for the other 4 charts as well.
