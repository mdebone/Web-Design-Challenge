# Web-Design-Challenge

Okay got around not being able to add the index.html by adding a notebook and changing it to index.html

I had a technical difficulty with this assignment in that none of the GitLab lessons, days 1 to 3, didn't have anything in them. Typically there are 10 to 15 assignments for each of the days, but all of these were marked down with a '=========' and nothing else.
Did not impact any of the other lessons, but I could not stash and delete the currupted files on my end and then re-pull, since git said that it was already up to date. I went thru line by line to make sure that my conda had the correct installations, both base(the default and my PythonData) had everything that I needed. GitLab was the same, each one of the lessons was marked down with those slashes, so I reached out to my class and support classmates thru slack, no resolution there.
I was forced to watch the zoom videos to have a reference point for the creation of the website and that is not nearly as efficent as just being able to read. 

The issue has been resolved, but it came this afternoon. So I am still working on this and will resubmit as soon as it is something that resembles the requirements.
